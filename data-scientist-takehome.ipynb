    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Since you have been selected for this takehome, you have passed an initial resume screen. We believe that you have the potential to be the right person for this role.\n",
    "\n",
    "Much of your work as a data scientist at The Recycling Partnership will look like:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Analysis and acquisition of data.\n",
    "1. Implement innovative data flows, including machine learning pipelines.\n",
    "1. Work with others to scope out data needs and solutions.\n",
    "1. Work with backend engineer to help translate analyses into software products.\n",
    "\n",
    "This takehome is your opportunity to demonstrate that you have the right technical skills to accomplish that. \n",
    "\n",
    "We have received applications from candidates with a variety of backgrounds. While previous experience will factor into our overall assessment of the candidate, performance on this takehome will play a strong role in our final decision. The Recycling Partnership is a team of growth-oriented people across all verticals of the organization and we hire accordingly. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Some things we're looking for\n",
    "\n",
    "* Code is read more than it is written, so write code that is easy to read! Things like documentation in markdown cells, docstrings, type hinting, and descriptive names for variables and functions are appreciated.\n",
    "* It's a messy world out there. Where appropriate, demonstrate good practices for data validation and error handling.\n",
    "* Show off! If there is a cool tool or technique that you want to use, go for it. Make notes of any special libraries to be installed, along with versions.\n",

    "I put together a little SQLite database to use as a demo. It is distributed with this notebook, called `veterinary_clinic.sqlite`. It contains a bit of data for an imaginary veterinary clinic. In the database, there are five tables:\n",
    "- `pet_type`: an enumeration of pet types like: `'dog'`, `'cat'`, etc\n",
    "- `veterinarian`: the veterinarians in the clinic's practice\n",
    "- `person`: the people who provide homes and care for the pets\n",
    "- `pet`: the pets who are patients at the clinic\n",
    "- `pet_person`: a join table between Persons and Pets, a many-to-many relationship\n",

    "\n",
    "The aim of this part is to show how you would approach the data and doing the analysis. Feel free to use as much code/space/cells as you like, just try to make sure that the notebook is runnable, repeatable. Here are some questions we'd like to see your analysis answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For all of the pet types at this clinic, what is the average age of each pet type (only including pets which are currently alive)? Please give the answer in days.\n",
    "1. Which veterinarian at the clinic has the most patients?\n",
    "1. Which veterinarian at the clinic sees the most \"exotic\" pets? For the purposes of this problem, consider \"exotic\" to mean any pet type which is not `'cat'` or `'dog'`. \n",
    "1. Spot the clerical error. Someone forgot to assign a person to one of the pets. Which pet has no person?\n",
    "1. Make a \"call-sheet\" CSV. Imagine the clinic needs to get in touch with their client Persons for an important announcement. The staff will use this sheet to make the calls. Include the following columns:\n",
    "    1. client_id: `person.id`\n",
    "    1. client_name: `person.name`\n",
    "    1. phone: `person.phone`\n",
    "    1. email: `person.email`\n",
    "    1. pets: A comma-separated list of each of their living pet's names. example: `'Josie, Eddie, Mercury, Chandra'`\n",
    "    1. vets: A comma-separated list of each of their living pets's primary vets. Often only one, but may be more.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has a standard library module for working with SQLite: `sqlite3`. The documentation for it is here: https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html. A quickstart piece of code to use that could look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import sqlite3\n",
    "\n",
    "cursor = sqlite3.connect(\"veterinary_clinic.sqlite\").cursor()\n",
    "\n",
    "pet_type_rows = cursor.execute(\"SELECT * FROM pet_type;\").fetchall()\n",
    "print(pet_type_rows)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "But we encourage you to use whatever other tools you like. We frequently make use of SQLAlchemy. "
